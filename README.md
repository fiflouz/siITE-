# Anima Project

Welcome! This project has been automatically generated by [Anima](https://animaapp.com/).

## Getting started

> **Prerequisites:**
> The following steps require [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) to be installed on your system, so please
> install it beforehand if you haven't already.

To get started with your project, you'll first need to install the dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

Then, you'll be able to run a development version of the project with:

```
npm run dev
```

After a few seconds, your project should be accessible at the address
[http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)


If you are satisfied with the result, you can finally build the project for release with:

```
npm run build
```

## Next.js migration preview

This repository now also contains a Next.js 14 (App Router) skeleton inside the `next-app/` directory. It is
shipped with Tailwind CSS, TypeScript and the first pages required for the upcoming experience.

Install the dependencies for this sub-project with:

```
cd next-app
npm install
```

Useful scripts are exposed from the root `package.json` for convenience:

```
npm run dev:next     # Start Next.js dev server (port 3000 by default)
npm run build:next   # Build the Next.js app
npm run start:next   # Run the production server
npm run lint:next    # Lint the Next.js app
```

When deploying on Vercel (or any CI), set the root directory to `next-app` to target the new application.
